# Xamarin.Forms: change the background color for selected items in a ListView (iOS only)

A sample Xamarin.Forms app that shows how to change the background color for selected items in a ListView

The code implements a custom renderer in the iOS project, and a CustomViewCell class in the .NET Standard project to subclass the ViewCell type. Then, in XAML, the CustomViewCell is used in the ListView's item template.
